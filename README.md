# Focus Extension

Focus (https://heyfocus.com) is a Mac application that blocks distractions like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc...

It works out of the box with Safari, Chrome and Vivaldi, but needs an extension for other browsers like Firefox.

This single extension should work for all of those other browsers.
